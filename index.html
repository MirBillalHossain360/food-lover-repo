            <p>During my second year at college, I thought Valentine's Day would pass as uneventfully as it did the
                first year. But earlier that week, Kyle said he didn't have plans and offered to come over and make
                spaghetti. We'd been hanging out ever since Hurricane Ivan brought us together on a friend's living room
                floor. He'd been a reliable ride to Walmart and bouncer for my house parties. I wasn't going to turn
                down free food or company on the dreaded Valentine's Day since both of my roommates had boyfriends and
                plans. Kyle whisked in to my apartment with bags of groceries — much more than I thought was necessary
                for a pot of spaghetti. He broke a little sweat as he chopped onions and peppers and basil. He liberally
                sprinkled oregano and other spices on the meat and browned everything as the noodles cooked in my best
                pot. My roommate walked into the kitchen for water just as he was preparing to plate. "Aww. Are y'all
                dating now?" Neither of us would confirm or deny. Eleven years later, I can still remember the taste of
                my husband's sincerity.</p>

                    <p>When Nana's asked to look after her poorly grandson, she knows something that might just make him
                        feel better - her 'magic' soup. Somehow it seems to do the trick, even though she sneaks in a
                        few
                        ingredients that he doesn't strictly like. But if he ever finds out, he won't kick up a fuss
                        because
                        it tastes so good. It's win-win for Nana: not only does the soup cheer her grandson up, she also
                        knows he's getting a nutritious meal.

                    <p>Preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C. To make the Dauphinoise, layer the potatoes in a
                        baking dish, seasoning every other layer.
                        In a jug, mix the cream, milk, garlic and thyme leaves. Season, then pour over the potatoes.
                        Grate a thin layer of Parmesan over the top if you like, then cover with foil and bake for 1 hr.
                        Remove the foil and cook for a further 15 mins until browned on top.
